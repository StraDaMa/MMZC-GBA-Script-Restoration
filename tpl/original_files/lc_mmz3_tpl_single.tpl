	  The legendary Reploid Zero 
	 awoke from a long slumber...
	
	
	  With Ciel's Resistance he
	  defeated Copy X, the ruler
	       of Neo Arcadia.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	    The terror of the Neo
	    Arcadian regime ended,
	
	
	   but the energy shortage
	 remained a constant problem.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	   Ciel devoted herself to
	   researching new forms of
	           energy.
	
	
	 And Elpizo became the newly
	 appointed Resistance leader.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	   However, overcome by his
	      desire for power, 
	
	
	   Elpizo awakened the Dark
	   Elf, whose magic had once
	  nearly destroyed the world.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	   Elpizo, thirsting for the
	  power of the Dark Elf, lost
	    sight of his true duty,
	
	
	   and was finally defeated
	    after a fierce battle.
	
	
	  However, the Dark Elf fled,
	  her destination unknown...
	
	
	
	
	
	
	 The battle over the Dark Elf
	    had only just begun...
